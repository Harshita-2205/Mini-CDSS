# Clinical Report

**Patient Demographics:**

- Age: 42 years
- Sex: Male

**History:**

- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago.

**Presenting Complaint:**

Polyuria, polydipsia, blurred vision, and fatigue for the past 2 weeks.

**Signs and Symptoms:**

- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Blurred vision
- Fatigue
- Microaneurysms
- Cotton wool spots

**Examinations Before Checkup:**

- Physical Examination
- Fundoscopic examination

**Vital Signs:**

- Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg

**Laboratory Values:**

- Random blood sugar: 350 mg/dl
- HbA1c: 10.5%

**Additional Summary:**

Intravenous fluids, insulin infusion, and electrolyte replacement initiated.

## Preliminary Diagnoses:

### 1. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)

**Reasoning:** The patient's presentation aligns with HHS: significantly elevated blood glucose (350 mg/dl), HbA1c of 10.5% indicating poor long-term glycemic control, polyuria, polydipsia, and severe dehydration (implied by intravenous fluid initiation). The presence of blurred vision and fatigue are also consistent with HHS. The patient's type 2 diabetes history increases the risk significantly.

**Recommendations:**

- Urgent admission to the hospital for close monitoring of blood glucose, electrolytes, and hydration status.
- Continue insulin infusion as per the current management plan.
- Regular assessment of neurological status.
- Electrolyte correction as needed.

- **Clinical Practice Guidelines:** [Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state](https://www.rch.org.au/clinicalguide/guideline_index/Hyperosmolar_hyperglycaemic_state/) - _Summary:_ Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) is a medical emergency of serum hyperosmolality, hyperglycaemia and dehydration without ketoacidosis.

### 2. Diabetic Retinopathy

**Reasoning:** The presence of microaneurysms and cotton wool spots on fundoscopic examination strongly suggests diabetic retinopathy. These are characteristic findings of retinal damage due to chronic hyperglycemia. The patient's long-standing type 2 diabetes significantly increases the likelihood of this complication.

**Recommendations:**

- Detailed ophthalmological evaluation to assess the severity of retinopathy.
- Regular eye examinations to monitor disease progression.
- Treatment strategies including laser photocoagulation or anti-VEGF injections might be considered based on the severity.

**Best Practices Resources:**

- **BMJ Best Practice:** [Diabetic retinopathy - Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment](https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/532) - _Summary:_ (Partial summary available, full access requires subscription). Sight-threatening signs include macular edema, retinal or optic disk new vessels, and vitreous hemorrhage.
- **Guideline Central:** [Comparing Diabetic Retinopathy Guidelines](https://www.guidelinecentral.com/blog/diabetic-retinopathy-side-by-side/) - _Summary:_ Compares guidelines from AAO, AOA, and ADA; highlights anti-VEGF therapy in advanced stages.

### 3. Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**Reasoning:** The patient's markedly elevated random blood sugar (350 mg/dl) and HbA1c (10.5%) clearly indicate poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. This lack of control is contributing to the acute presentation (HHS) and long-term complications (retinopathy). The classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and fatigue further support this diagnosis.

**Recommendations:**

- Intensified diabetes management plan, including adjustment of insulin regimen, lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise), and patient education.
- Regular self-monitoring of blood glucose.
- Regular follow-up with an endocrinologist or diabetes specialist to optimize glycemic control.
